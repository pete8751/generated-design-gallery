"generated-design-gallery"

This project is an art gallery website of AI generated art. It is fullstack, and hence I have created the database and server.
I have deployed this project with the help of render to host my database and server, and am hosting the frontend using github pages.
In this project I am mainly focusing on Backend, as I am working on gaining more expertise in creating RESTful APIs, and optimizing databases.

I am also experimenting with cookies on this project, which remove the need to login to the page, as I store all important inputs in cookies.

This is the link to the current version of the project that has been deployed:

===================================================================================================================================================
Currently: I am essentially done with the Backend part of this project, and have started working on the frontend. I have made the footers/headers
of the project aesthetic, and have increased responsiveness. I am now working on making the body of each page look better, and adding some final functionality.

TODO: 
1. Style the body of each page.
2. Make website fully responsive.
3. Initiate a download when user purchases in the cart.
4. Add a Success page, as well as an About page.
