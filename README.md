This project is an art gallery website of AI generated art. It is fullstack, and hence I have created the database and server,
which I am hosting on render. The frontend is hosted on github pages.
In this project I am mainly focusing on Backend, as I am working on gaining more expertise in creating RESTful APIs, and optimizing databases.

I am also experimenting with cookies on this project, which remove the need to login to the page, and create unnecessary communication with the database.
I may add a login feature down the line, however I am currently more interested in working with cookies.

Please note that since the Backend is hosted on a free hosting service (Render), there is a windup time of around 7-8 seconds, after which the website
will begin communicating with the server and database at normal speeds.

======================================================================================================================================================
Currently: I am essentially done with the Backend part of this project, and have started working on the frontend. I have made the footers/headers
of the project aesthetic, and have increased responsiveness. I am now working on making the body of each page look better, and adding some final functionality.

TODO: 
1. Style the body of each page.
2. Make website fully responsive.
3. Initiate a download when user purchases in the cart.
4. Add a Success page, as well as an About page.
